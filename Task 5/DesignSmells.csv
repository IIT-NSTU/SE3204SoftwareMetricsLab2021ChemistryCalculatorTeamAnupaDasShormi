Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
chemistry-calculator,ChemistryCalculator.backend,Compound,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: CompoundManager; Compound
chemistry-calculator,ChemistryCalculator.backend,Converter.Step,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: unit; value
chemistry-calculator,ChemistryCalculator.backend,Converter.Step,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
